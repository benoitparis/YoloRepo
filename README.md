####Why?
Because yolo, I might say?

####If this code is deployed, won't that create huge security and privacy issues?
Yes, I am certain it will.

####Is it deployed somewhere?
Yes, at yolorepo.com. 

####Should I go to yolorepo.com? Do you take responsibility of any kind should I go to this site?
No and no, see above.

####What about the license?
License is [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/), for all usage of anything here, for things you request to get merged here.

####Is there a roadmap?
No. This repository is what you want it to be.

####Are there rules?
No. This being said, I think at some point people will be asked not to replace everything by a single picture of a cat playing the accordion.

####Are there specific technologies that are to be used?
No. Choose what you want. Only static files are served for now though.
